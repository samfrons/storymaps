    "description": "This is an interactive map of The exhibition Final Sale: The End of Jewish Owned Businesses in Nazi Berlin, whixh is based on the findings of research carried out by staff and students at the Department of Modern German History of Berlin's Humboldt University. The conclusive findings of the research project, which investigated the fate of small and medium-sized businesses in Berlin 1930-45, was published in 2012. The exhibition was produced in cooperation with the historical society Aktives Museum Faschis-\nmus und Widerstand in Berlin e.V., which has been devoted to creating historical exhibitions with a biographical focus since its inception in 1983.\nSixteen businesses were selected from the large number and wide variety of Jewish businesses in Berlin for the exhibition. Although they do not provide a comprehensive picture, they serve as examples for branches, fields of business and specific contexts which have previously not been the focus of historical interest. The intention is to add less widely known information to the cases already well documented in order to uncover new aspects of the history of Jewish commercial enterprise in Berlin during this period. The individual case histories are framed by photos of Berlin businesses which were targeted by boycott or willful destruction, visualizing the concrete threat that Jewish businesses faced. In this case, some well known photos were included of stores at unknown locations. Thanks to the\nproject's database, these could be accurately identified for the first time.",

    "description": "Founded by brothers Emanuel and Josef Braun in Vienna, E. Braun & Co. began as a bridal wear and accessories store. The company expanded to become a supplier to the Austrian imperial court, opening branches in Karlovy Vary and Prague. In 1914, they established their Berlin branch on Unter den Linden 75, which grew into a luxurious store offering formal wear, table linen, and home accessories.\n\nEmanuel Braun, considered the inventor of the boutique concept, partnered with Siegfried Franz Oser-Braun to run the Berlin branch. The store flourished, with its premises renovated in 1926-1928 at a cost of 850,000 Reich marks.\n\nHowever, Austria's annexation in 1938 dramatically changed the company's fortunes. Siegfried Franz Oser-Braun was arrested, and while in detention, was forced to sell the company to Georg Wiedemann. The Oser-Braun family fled, first to London, then Egypt, and finally to the USA in 1941.\n\nAfter the war, the company was returned to its founders' heirs. Henry Myer (formerly Hans Friedrich Mayer-Braun) became director in 1962. The Berlin branch, destroyed during the war, was not rebuilt. In 1988, Gustavo Oser sold the rights to the company name.",

    "description": "Founded in 1883, the Deutsche Theater on Schumann Strasse became the epicenter of Berlin's theatrical world under the visionary leadership of Max Reinhardt. From 1906 to 1933, Reinhardt transformed this modest playhouse into a cultural powerhouse, pioneering innovative staging techniques and nurturing new dramatic talent.\n\nAt its peak, the DT was the crown jewel of Reinhardt's theatrical empire, which included 12 theaters and over 10,000 seats across Berlin. The theater's success allowed Reinhardt to experiment with grand productions, including the opening of the Grosse Schauspielhaus in 1919, which seated an astounding 3,200 spectators.\n\nHowever, the Deutsche Theater's golden age came to an abrupt end in 1933 when the Nazis systematically ousted Reinhardt, a Jewish artist, from his position. This seizure represented more than just a business takeover; it was a calculated move by the Nazi regime to appropriate the theater's prestige and cultural significance for their own propaganda purposes.\n\nReinhardt's forced exile marked a tragic turning point, not only for the Deutsche Theater but for German culture as a whole. The theater, once a beacon of artistic innovation and freedom, became a tool in the hands of a repressive regime, its legacy of creativity and inclusivity temporarily erased from Berlin's cultural landscape.\n\nToday, the Deutsche Theater stands as a poignant reminder of both the heights of artistic achievement and the depths of cultural persecution in 20th century Germany.",

Establishing himself in the 1920s, Fröhlich built a successful enterprise that prospered until 1936, adapting to economic challenges and expanding to serve major department stores. Forced to flee in 1939, the Fröhlichs endured a two-year wait in Cuba before reaching the United States. Despite initial struggles in America, including a brief stint making army hats and unsuccessful attempts at philately, Fröhlich's legacy lived on through his son Peter, who became a renowned historian. Peter Gay's autobiographical work, \"My German Question: Growing Up in Berlin 1933-1939,\" stands as a poignant testament to his father's resilience and the family's enduring impact on cultural and intellectual life, even in exile.",

However, the rise of Nazi power in 1933 brought far-reaching changes, subjecting Jewish businessmen like Höxter to verbal abuse, boycotts, and systematic exclusion from the market. Despite initial resilience, the company's fortunes declined sharply under increasing anti-Semitic pressures and restrictions. By 1936, faced with untenable conditions, the Höxter family made the difficult decision to emigrate, closing a chapter on a once-prosperous business that fell victim to the Nazis' ruthless economic policies targeting Jewish enterprises.",

However, the rise of Nazi power in 1933 brought devastating changes.

By 1935, the business faced forced closure amidst a wider campaign to eliminate Jewish traders from the egg market.

Located near Alexanderplatz, it offered credit vouchers and catered to budget-conscious shoppers, growing from a mail-order business to a retail empire. The store's innovative design, complete with rooftop restaurant and garden, made it a local landmark. However, its success attracted Nazi attention, leading to its early appropriation even before 1933. By 1930, the store became a focal point for Nazi rallies, with its Jewish heritage erased. The company's 1933 report revealed a façade of normalcy, but behind the scenes, SA intimidation and boycotts devastated profits. In a final blow, Golluber was forced from the board in 1935, and the store was \"Aryanized.\" This transformation from a thriving Jewish-owned business to a propaganda hub for the Nazi regime starkly illustrates the systematic economic persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany.",

Hungarian-born Kutschera transformed these establishments into popular international meeting spots, only to see them become targets of escalating anti-Semitic attacks. From the violent \"Kurfürstendamm riots\" of 1935 to the slanderous campaign by Der Stürmer in 1936, Kutschera's businesses faced relentless pressure. Despite initial resilience, he was eventually forced to lease to non-Jewish shareholders, with the Zigeunerkeller infamously declaring \"Jews not welcome.\" The Kutschera family's subsequent deportation to Theresienstadt in 1943, resulting in the loss of two children in Auschwitz, reflected the broader tragedy of the Holocaust. Yet, in a testament to remarkable resilience, Karl and Josephine Kutschera survived, returned to Berlin post-war, and revived Café Wien. Kutschera's journey from successful entrepreneur to Nazi target, and his post-war resurgence, encapsulates the complex narrative of Jewish business owners in Nazi Germany and the enduring spirit of survival.",

The Reich Culture Chamber Law of 1933 led to Nazi control of the college, with SA members occupying the grounds and harassing students and tutors.\n\nIn 1935, the Reimanns were forced to sell the college to Hugo Häring, a non-Jewish principal. Although former Bauhaus artists continued teaching, the college faced severe criticism from Nazi authorities. The Reich Economic Ministry pushed for closure, citing the college's \"Jewish influence.\" Despite Häring's efforts to prove the college's profitability and \"Aryanization,\" financial difficulties mounted.",
